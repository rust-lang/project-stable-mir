Welcome to the repository for the Stable MIR Librarification Project Group! Our goal is to provide a stable
API based on the rust compiler mid-level intermediate representation (MIR) that can be used as the foundation
for development of tools that want to perform sophisticated analyses and make stronger guarantees about the
behavior of Rust programs.


This is the repository we use to organise our work. Please refer to our [charter] as well
as our [github pages website][gh-pages] for more information on our goals and
current scope.
